# Summary

This is a case for the Raspberry Pi 3 B.

This came as a challenge from a friend of mine who wanted a secure case, but did not want the bulge of external screw, like on my previous case series: Safe and Secure Case which can be found here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:423216

In this iteration, I decided to use M2.5 socket head screw, so this meant I could use the holes in the motherboard to secure the case in place. Hence, this is the result. The case is 20 mm high and about 2-3 mm thick. This make for a very compact case.

I'll add more top and bottom design upon request.

Enjoy.

Edit 1: Added honeycomb top upon request.
Edit 2: Added 40mm Fan top upon request.


# Print Settings

Printer: Ike:Core
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Infill: 80%

Notes: 
This case is designed to be printed at 0.25 mm for layer height.

It uses 4 x M2.5 20mm socket head screws to secure the case.

I printed mine at 80% infill.

I only print in PLA, and this case has 0.2 mm 0.25 mm in tolerance, which means, if you ooze too much or are using ABS, think about enlarging the print by 1%.

Also, any brim used, or first layer being squashed a lot, be prepared to use an X-Acto to remove the extra plastic for the screw head and nut traps.

There is a 0.25 mm layer of plastic that makes the transition between the 8 holes and their respective shafts. It has to be removed as well.  

# How I Designed This

This is designed with Fusion 360.

The Fusion 360 source file is included, but remember, Fusion 360 cannot open a local file, you must first upload it to your cloud in order to see/edit it.
