I'm using (from memory):

0.25mm z distance.
75% xy distance.
3mm support spacing.
4 interface layers.
0.2mm interface layer spacing.
I think those are the key settings. Exposed support pulls off easily. Any entangled with the part (e.g. between legs) requires cutting to separate before pulling apart. 

These settings are working well for me with PLA and both 0.25 and 0.40mm nozzles. Haven't tried much else.
