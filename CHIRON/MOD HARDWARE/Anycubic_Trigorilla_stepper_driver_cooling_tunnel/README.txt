# Summary

Cooling tunnel for Anycubic kossel trigorilla board. The tunnel is high enough for those big heatsinks for TMC2208 & TMC2100. I fitted those big ones on mine, check the pictures. Fits a standard 5015 blower fan. I got mine from aliexpress. I used a 24V version connected to 12V, this is a lot quieter than the full blast from the 12V fan. So far this seems to provide adequate cooling.

The fan is mounted with 2 screws, and the tunnel is fixed to the trigorilla board with 1 screw through the hole in the corner of the board. No glue or other stuff needed, just some screws and nuts.



V2 UPDATE:
I got feedback that the fan opening interferes slightly with the thermistor connectors. They can still be attached, but they push against the tunnel without any clearance. I uploaded V2 of this tunnel, in this version the fan opening has a slight offset to the right so it doesn't interfere with the thermistor connectors anymore.
