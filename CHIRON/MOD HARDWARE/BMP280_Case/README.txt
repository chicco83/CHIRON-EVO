# Summary

Case For a BMP280 Temperature and Pressure sensor. I'm making a project (temperature controlled exhaust fan) that uses one of these and need a way to mount it.

This is inspired by but not derived from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2584381

Two tabs to allow for mounting. support for the board inside the case. Slot for connector for easy wiring. 'BMP280' labels for play value.

# Print Settings

Printer: Monoprice Maker Select Plus
Rafts: No
Supports: Yes
Resolution: .12mm layer, .4mm nozzle

Notes: 
Infill doesn't likely matter - the sections are so small this will probably print solid. Supports needed for cover if you print outside up. Sensor can be glued or hot fused to base if desired, same for cover.

# Post-Printing

You might need to clean out the mounting holes with a drill bit.
