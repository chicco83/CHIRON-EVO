# Summary

This is the quickest way to level your Chiron bed 400x400 version not the 400x380.  This print takes about 25 minutes and prints a 1 layer circle on the 25 points that it does its leveling.

1 - Do a manual leveling so the bed is somewhat level.  Use a sheet of paper and level various points. Besure to have the bed heated.

2 - Follow Anycubic's instructions for doing an auto bed leveling. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RudXmCgobso&t=49s

3 - Instead of using their "Level_Test.gcode" use this one.

4 - As the outer ring is printing goto Tools - More - Level and begin to lower until it is close.    This can be as much as -1.50 or -3.00  Do not go too much.  Every printer is different.  I usually stop the print and will start again before the circles start to print till the outside lines start to stick.

5 - I then let it print all 25 circles.  I try to take a marker and number them like the grid.  They tend to pop up and you do not know where they went.

6 - If there are gaps the print head needs to be lower -.  If is is solid but very bumpy usually the print head is to close and you need to add space +.

Do this print as many times as needed till is is right.  Sometimes takes 2-3 times,  other 4-6.  I also level with the material I plan to be using (PLA, ABS, ETC..).
